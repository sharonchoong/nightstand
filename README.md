#Nightstand App

A simple web app to turn my old little-used tablet into a nightstand to show time and weather.  Check it out [here](https://sharonchoong.github.io/nightstand)

I'm using the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.  Since Github Pages websites are static, it's not possible to completely hide the API key server-side.  As an alternative, to see the weather, the app requires the user to input the API key manually in the settings for first use; a little inconvenient.  [Signing up for a key is free](https://openweathermap.org/api).

This project was written with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and has responsive design from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
